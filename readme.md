Current plan - quickly scaffold this idea out using python, swap to something
more sustainable once the skeleton is in place.

- [x] Python <-> Locally hosted webpage
- [x] Send forwards json full of dummy textboxes
- [x] Render that on the page
- [x] Move HTML into its own file
- [ ] Re-add styling from dungeon-note-2
- [ ] Click textbox to entire bounding mode edit (corners, drag and drop, etc)
- [ ] Have changes get pushed backwards to python
- [ ] Swap to elm for frontend

- [ ] Watch file in python, grab list of textboxes from there
- [ ] Save Changes when made
- [ ] Proper Markdown parsing
- [ ] Re-add menu bar
- [ ] Lines
- [ ] Math
- [ ] Write tests
- [ ] find out other things that should be on this list.
